Tumble,An airborne state after a character has been launched greater than 80 units by an attack.

OOS,"Stands for Out of shield, often refered to when figuring out what moves your character can do when an opponent hits your shield."
AC,"Stands for Attack cancel, refers to cancelling your move within 1-2 frames with an aerial. This can cause your momentum to shift in the opposite direction during this aerial and is often required for specific combos to occur."
