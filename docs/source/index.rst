   If you notice any inaccurate information or would like to improve this guide, y ou can contribute to the project on the `public GitHub repository <https://github.com/the-potatocouch/bjr/>`_ by submitting a pull request.

This guide was originally made by `Fumble <https://twitter.com/FunbleJr/>`_ and adapted into a proper Sphinx documentation by `PotatoCouch <https://twitter.com/the_potatocouch/>`_

The goal for the document is to be an accessible resource for Bowser Jr players looking to improve. It includes lists of useful tech, tips on playing the character, and matchup advice.

Here you will find instructions for fundamental Smash skills, Jr's bread and butter combos, set ups and advanced techniques. It is not neccessary to learn every single last piece of tech in this documentation, but the more effort you put in the more Jr will reward you.  

If you are new to competitive Smash, or Smash in general, we highly suggest you start with the `Fundamentals <fundamentals>`_ page.
